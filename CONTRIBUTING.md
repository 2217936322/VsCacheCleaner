## :earth_africa: Translate

*VsCacheCleaner* is developed using *Qt* for the UI part.

You can use [*Qt Linguist*](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtlinguist-index.html) to easily translate *VsCacheCleaner*.

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/SpriteOvO/VsCacheCleaner/issues/new/choose) and tell us the target language to request the `.ts` translation file.

Open the `.ts` translation file through *Qt Linguist* to start the translation, see the *Qt Linguist* [documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-translators.html) for more details.

When you finish translating, save the `.ts` translation file and [submit a PR](https://github.com/SpriteOvO/VsCacheCleaner/compare) to us for review and merge.

If you need any help, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/SpriteOvO/VsCacheCleaner/issues/new/choose).

## :rocket: Improve code
[Submit a PR](https://github.com/SpriteOvO/VsCacheCleaner/compare) to fix a known bug or try something from the TODO list.

But we recommend that you [open an issue](https://github.com/SpriteOvO/VsCacheCleaner/issues/new/choose) for discussion before that.
